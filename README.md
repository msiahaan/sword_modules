# Alkitab TB (Terjemahan Baru) modules for SWORD project

I created Alkitab TB modules for SWORD Project (https://www.crosswire.org/sword/index.jsp).

The ideas is to convert Indonesia bible texts from text format into OSIS format. OSIS OSIS is an XML standard for encoding Bibles and other biblical research texts, which enables ministries and other organizations to collaborate more easily

However this modules never submitted to SWORD Project because not allowed by LAI as copyright holder of Indonesia Alkitab TB.
